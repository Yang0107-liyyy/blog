# Hiüñêüèª I am Lillian

- I am a new comer who is diligently studying front-end development. 
My original major was accounting, but I chose to enter the field of front-end development due to my interest and opportunities. 
Through self-study, I have mastered basic technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and can use some tools to complete small projects. 
Front-end development has given me a sense of creativity from nothing to something ‚Äî although I may encounter doubts and setbacks in the process, 
the sense of achievement when the final work is presented makes me incredibly happy, which is also the driving force for me to keep learning. üí™üèª

- During the process of learning and writing projects, I often encounter various problems, 
so I go to look up information, see others' solutions, and then summarize them with my own understanding.
I will write blog posts about the difficult problems I encounter, the solutions, and the new knowledge I learn and share them, 
hoping to help people who are on the same learning path as me. If my experience can bring a little inspiration to others, 
it would be a great honor and joy for me. üòÉ

- I believe in 'Live to learn, learn to the end of life.' 
Front-end development is both a challenge and an opportunity for me, and there is still a lot of knowledge for me to explore. 
In the future, I will continuously accumulate experience and improve my technical level, looking forward to the day when I can grow into a real tech giant! 
(Dreams must be had, what if they come true? HahaÔΩû)
